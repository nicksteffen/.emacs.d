This package provides the minor mode annotate-mode, which can add
annotations to arbitrary files without changing the files
themselves. Annotations are saved in the annotate-file
(~/.annotations by default).

To add annotations to a file, select a region and hit C-c C-a. The
region will be underlined, and the annotation will be displayed in
the right margin. Annotations are saved whenever the file is saved.
